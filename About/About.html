    <h2>HISTORY OF THE CHERUBIM & SERAPHIM MOVEMENT CHURCH (AYO NI O), ILE-IFE DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS, MBABI-MBAYO</h2>
    <p>Since history helps to understand the past in relation to the future, human beings have hitherto played their roles in ensuring continuity and change in time. Therefore, it will not be out of order to give a brief account of the advent of the first Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (C&SMC) in Ile-Ife. The genesis of the Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church (Ayo Ni O), Mbabi-Mbayo, Ile-Ife could be traced to the direction, power and grace of God, and to the inspiration of the people of God like late Special Apostle Prophet E. O. Akinrele, a native of Ile-Ife, Apostle M. O. Rufai and late Senior Apostle A. O. Isola, to mention a few. </p>
    <p>In 1980, the journey started at the then University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. There was a C&S brand on campus which was a combination of different kinds of C&S brands but were majorly composed of members from the C&SMC with their styles and mode of worship. Many of the students had come together in order to have a Cherubim & Seraphim (C&S) Church in unification, first of its kind in any higher institution in Nigeria. Among these students are: Apostle M. O. Rufai, who was the leader, J. K. Coker, who was the secretary and late Senior Apostle A. O. Isola, who was the deputy leader. Senior Apostle Prophet S. S. Kolarin and Senior Apostle E. A. Garba were the role models for the fast growing church on campus. Thus, as there was no C&SMC in Ile-Ife and its environs, many who were interested in this kind of C&S brand decided to be worshipping with students in the university. </p>
    <p>However, in 1981, members from town were dampened by attendance of members whenever the students were on vacation. So also, the members at times found it difficult to get means of transportation to the campus for worship. These challenges propelled late Senior Apostle A. O. Isola to inform Pa Akinrele of possible way out. Pa Akinrele then advised him to look for a suitable place in town where members in town would be able to worship together.</p>
    <p>A vacant land located at No. 10, Ibadan Road near AP Petrol filling station, Ile-Ife, owned by Pa Raji Oyinlola was acquired. The place was built with wood and roofed with iron sheets even though it was on lease. It was Pa Akinrele who led late Senior Apostle A. O. Isola to the Baba Aladura, late Special Apostle S. O. Kalejaye at the Conference held at Ilorin for its approval. This request, the spiritual father graciously granted. With this approval thus emerged the very first C&SMC in Ile-Ife and its environs.</p>
    <p>Many prominent members of C&SMC contributed to the growth of the church morally, financially and spiritually. These include: Special Apostle G. O. Fakeye, Senior Apostle E. A. Garba, Special Apostle Prophet T. Ade Martins amongst others. The temporary church at AP was dedicated on 28th November, 1981. Late Senior Apostle A. O. Isola was the first leader of the church, deputised by Senior Apostle M. A. Sobande, while late Senior Apostle J. T. Akinsanya was the secretary.</p>
    <p>In 1982, the present permanent site of the church was purchased. It was a six-plot of land situated at No. 1, Ayo Ni Street, Mbabi-Mbayo layout, off Oluorogbo Road 7, Ile-Ife. The members of the church moved from the temporary site to this permanent site on Sunday, 22nd February, 1987, thereby holding their first service on this special day. </p>

    <h4>Tragic Moment</h4>
    <p>On Sunday, November 8, 1987, the church was left in a sad mood with the demise of important personalities in the church. The then leader (Late Senior Apostle A. O. Isola) and the secretary (Late Senior Apostle J. T. Akinsanya) had a fatal accident on their way back from the C&SMC National Conference held at Kaduna. They lost their lives through this accident and the whole church was put in a mourning mood. </p>
    <p>The sad event dampened the morale of many members but some of the elderly ones took courage in God and strengthened the others. Among these elders include: Most Senior Apostle S. O. Owolabi, Most Senior Apostle Adeola Ola and Most Senior Apostle Adeoye. </p>

    <h4>Choosing a New Leader</h4>
    <p>Since the church cannot be left without a leader, it was generally agreed upon that Most Senior Apostle M. A. Sobande should act as the leader, which he did for three years. In 1990, in order to select a new leader, five (5) names were sent to the mother church in Lagos, that is, the C&SMC Surulere, for spiritual guidance in selecting a new leader. Out of the names sent, the name of Senior Apostle G. O. Omisore was divinely selected.</p>
    <p>On 10th February, 1991, Special Apostle Prophet E. O. Akinrele and some elders from Lagos, as well as representatives of Baba Aladura J. T. Agboola installed Senior Apostle G. O. Omisore as the new leader of the church. Subsequently, the church requested for a paid prophet for the smooth running of the church. On 24th August, 1991, Senior Apostle Prophet M. O. Oyedokun who hails from Ibadan was sent to the church as the prophet-in-charge.  </p>

    <h4>Journey to Becoming a District</h4>
    <p>After the installation of a new leader and a prophet-in-charge, the next point of call was active growth of the church. This was initiated and pursued vigorously by the new leaders, to the extent that the church really experienced a massive increase in development. The church being annexed under the Surulere District, were inclined to attend meetings, seminars and so on in Lagos. Their contributions were seen in all aspects that relate to the growth of the District. This impressed the then District Leader, late Special Apostle G. O. Fakeye, to the extent of him recommending Ile-Ife to be an autonomous district in 1994. But before a district could be granted, there must have been at least five (5) branches in such a town as at that period in time. Thus, the likes of Senior Apostle A. A. Adedoyin, Senior Apostle S. O. Owolabi and Senior Apostle M. O. Oyedokun swung into action and made sure the dream to be a district came to reality.</p>
    <p>However, the movement for the actualisation of a district met a stumbling block, which later on became a blessing in disguise. The prophet-in-charge, Senior Apostle Prophet M. O. Oyedokun seceded and formed his own branch of C&SMC at Aladanla on Sunday, July 10, 1996. Before his secession, the church had gotten three branches under Ile-Ife proposed District. These are: C&SMC Ifewara, C&SMC Irawo Ogo Jesu, Dada Estate, Osogbo and C&SMC Orogba, Ilesa.</p>
    <p>The sporadic and rapid development of Ile-Ife church with copious branches made it possible to grant the status of DISTRICT. This approval was announced at the C&SMC Zaria Conference held in 1996 by His Grace Baba Aladura J. T. Agboola. On Sunday, 9th November, 1997, the Ile-Ife District under the chairmanship of Special Apostle G. O. Omisore was inaugurated by the Baba Aladura of all C&SMC Worldwide. Special Apostle Prophet M. O. Oyedokun was the Deputy Chairman, while Senior Apostle A. A. Adedoyin was the Senior District Secretary (SDS).</p>

    <h4>Leadership of the Church</h4>
    <p>Since the leadership positions in the headquarters cannot be left vacant with the elevation of the leader and secretary of the church, men of valour were sought to fill up the positions. In this wise, the mantle of leadership fell on Most Senior Apostle M. Adeola Ola and was anointed on the same with the district officials on Sunday, 9th November, 1997 as the leader of the church, the position which he had held till date. The church secretary then was Senior Apostle (Prof.) J.A. Adeyoju, ably assisted by Most Senior Apostle J. A. Akinfenwa. But few months later, Senior Apostle (Prof.) J. A. Adeyoju stopped coming to church. This made the church to appoint Most Senior Apostle J. A. Akinfenwa as the church secretary, while Senior Apostle J. D. Elugbaju became the assistant secretary</p>
    <p>After the 2009 international conference of the C&SMC, a letter came from His Grace Most Revd J. A. Abidoye, the new chairman and Baba Aladura of C&SMC worldwide that church office holders should not spend more than five years in office. Thus, there was a change in different offices in the church. Most Senior Apostle J. A. Akinfenwa became the Assistant District Secretary, Most Senior Apostle J. D. Elugbaju became the new Church Secretary, while D. S. Aina became the Assistant Church Secretary in 2010. </p>
    <p>In 2017, Special Apostle J. D. Elugbaju stepped down as the church secretary due to his willingness to allow others to continue with the good works of the secretariat unit. Hence, this gave D. S. Aina the opportunity to become the church secretary, the position which he still occupy till date. Others like Ap. Oluwaseun Olatunde and Ev. Folorunso Omoniyi were also brought on board as the Assistant Secretary I and Assistant Secretary II respectively.</p>
    <P>Indeed, the Lord has been faithful to the church as it is growing in all ramifications. May the Lord continue to help the church to grow in leaps and bounds, and may the kingdom of hell not have power over it in Jesus’ name, amen. Below are the branches under the church:</P>
